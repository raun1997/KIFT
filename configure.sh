# not needed, but it's good practice to install dependencies while making
# will complete this later if there is time
# if using flite. should probably have it compile during make rather than
# pre compiling it because our repo is gonna get huge that way
# for now just use it as a reference for how to install dependencies

# brew install brightness
# cd flite
# ./configure
# make
